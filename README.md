# Convolutional-NN-By-Hand

This Project implements a Convolutional Neural Network in a Keras-like style using only numpy/math. 
Each layer such as the Dense layer or the Convolutional Layer implements its own forward_prop and backward_prop methods which are then stitched together to form a Neural Network. 
The mnist.py file can be ran to show the results of the CNN on the mnist number classification problem for the binary classification of numbers 0 or 1.
